      <p>This site presents a Variorum Viewer for reading five versions of the novel <i>Frankenstein</i> in direct relation to each other. It represents an experiment in digital humanities with several methods: TEI text encoding, machine-assisted collation, and static web delivery of a distinctive interface that invites the reader to explore moments of variance across the five editions.</p>
    <p>To learn more about Mary Shelley and the origins of <i>Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus</i> in the summer of 1816, there are many resources available. For those seeking an orientation, we recommend <a href="https://romantic-circles.org/Editions/Article/about-mary-wollstonecraft-shelley#nb">the biographical resources for Mary Shelley available on Romantic Circles</a> as a starting point, together with the <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/frankenstein/the-frankenstein-notebooks-introduction/#mws_and_pbss_collaboration_in_the_frankenstein_notebooks">the detailed and authoritative introduction to the manuscript drafts of the novel by Charles E. Robinson available from the Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>. </p>

    <p>The five distinct versions of the novel were composed between 1816 and 1831. These include: </p>
    <ul>
    <li><label class="edition-label"><span class="dot ed-MS"></span>MS</label> The manuscript notebooks at the Bodleian Library thought to be a “fair copy” of the novel in Mary Shelley’s hand preparing it for publication, drafted in 1816-1817. Facsimile views and manuscript encoding of each page surface are provided by <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/frankenstein/">the Shelley-Godwin Archive (S-GA)</a>, and the TEI encoding from this project provides one of the five bases for machine-assisted collation in this project. The Variorum Viewer provides deep links into each page of this intricate S-GA edition.</li>
    <li><label class="edition-label"><span class="dot ed-1818"></span>1818</label> The first anonymous publication of the novel, published by <a href="https://knarf.english.upenn.edu/V1notes/lackingt.html">Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, & Jones in London, 1818</a>. We worked with the code of <a href="https://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Text/text.html">The Pennsylvania Electronic Edition’s 1990s hypertext of the 1818 edition</a>, transformed it to XML and corrected it against a photo facsimile of the 1818 edition so its markup would form the basis for locating chapter and paragraph boundaries in our collation.</li>
    <li><label class="edition-label"><span class="dot ed-Thomas"></span>Thomas</label> Mary Shelley’s handwritten edits and marginal notes inscribed in a copy of the 1818 edition <a href="https://www.themorgan.org/collection/frankenstein">that Mary Shelley left in Italy with a friend, Mrs. Thomas, nearly a year after the death of Percy Shelley in July 1822 and before she returned to England in August 1823</a>. The ”Thomas copy” indicates revisions that Mary Shelley contemplated sometime after the novel’s first printing, but her notes were not available to Mary Shelley to consult later. Thus, it represents a ”fork” in the version history of this novel.</li>
    <li><label class="edition-label"><span class="dot ed-1823"></span>1823</label> Inspired by the success of <a href="https://english.unl.edu/sbehrendt/texts/Presumption/presump.htm"><i>Presumption! or, The Fate of Frankenstein</i></a>, the first staged melodrama adaptation of his daughter’s novel</a>, William Godwin prepared a lightly edited version of the 1818 text for publication. Godwin’s 1823 edition, prepared before his daughter returned to England and without her assistance, is the first time the name of the author, “Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,” appears on the the title page. With the help of Carnegie Mellon library with OCR page images, we prepared the 1823 XML text for incorporation in the Frankenstein Variorum.</li>
    <li><label class="edition-label"><span class="dot ed-1831"></span>1831</label> Mary Shelley heavily revised the novel by 1831, and this revised version was first published in volume 9 of Bentley’s Standard Series of Novels (London: Henry Colburn &amp; Richard Bentley, 1831. As with the 1818 edition, we again worked with the code of <a href="https://knarf.english.upenn.edu/1831v1/ftitle.html">The Pennsylvania Electronic Edition</a> for preparing our XML text and corrected that text by consulting a photo facsimile.</li>.
    </ul>

    <p>The Frankenstein Variorum builds upon a distinguished tradition of scholarly editing in which scholars have investigated the novel’s early forms. Prior to the 1990s, most readers only encountered the latest 1831 text of <i>Frankenstein</i>, but work that began with James Rieger’s 1974 edition began to feature the first published version of the novel as remarkably distinct. The Pennsylvania Electronic Edition of <i>Frankenstein</i>, which provided the basis for two of our base texts, was an important experiment in digital editing that permitted the reader to study the 1818 and 1831 editions side by side without preferring either text over the other. Our own collation of five distinct editions is based on the strong foundation provided by distinguished textual scholars of this work who came before us, summarized in the following table. </p>

    <p>We launched our project to prepare for the bicentennial of <i>Frankenstein</i>’s first publication in 1818, thinking only to improve the comparison view of the 1818 and 1831 editions available on <a href="https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/frankenstein">Romantic Circles</a>. We determined to make five editions available and to take on the challenge of presenting a way to navigate the five texts as they relate to one another. The Variorum Viewer we designed provides a means to read each of the five editions from start to finish, but it is optimized for non-linear reading to investigate comparisons, and how particular passages transformed over time.</p>

    <p>The following are distinct editions prepared “under the hood” by correcting prior digital editions and preparing new digital editions the 1823 and Thomas edition. These files represent each edition prior to collation processing. Comparison data is not marked in these documents, but each is a distinct edition in its own right suitable for reading and annotation.</p>
